## Tailwind Fylo App build

-- This project was created following the Brad Traversy Tailwind CSS from Scratch course on Udemy

Overview;

This is the first Tailwind CSS course I've taken, I really enjoyed using the utility classes. I found it to be a fast method to create practical and functional layouts.

Thanks to Brad Traversy for such a great course, the projects look great and the delivery of the course is relaxed and to the point.
